# VerticalShootEmUp

This tiny game is my short (less than 2 hours) attempt to recapture the past glory of a similar game
that I wrote in Turbo Pascal. This implementation is much more primitive (back in the DOS days it
had color, score, background music and other fancy stuff), but I added a bit of SFX :-).

It's also a nice study material for beginners, if you can read Czech.
